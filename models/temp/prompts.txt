_data is a table of strings. Each row characterize an element to sort or tags. The first column give the names of the element or tags. The second column give the tags of the element or tags. The third column give the hard constraints and the optimization goals. For instance "appear before B1", "appear more than 5 time and less than 8", "must be placed as far as possible from each other".
Example :
_data = [
[["A1"], ["A"], ["placed two places before B1"]],
[["A2"], ["A", "t"], ["appears three times"]],
[["B"], ["r"], ["maximize distance"]],
[["B1", "the original B"], ["B", "t"], []],
]
A1 must be placed two places before B1, The right sorting would be A1, A2, B1, A2, A2.

Write the Python code to use _data and _column_role to sort the elements with cp_model.
